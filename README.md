 👋 Hi, I’m Iryna Murashko.
 
 bring over 4 years of experience as a QA engineer on long-term projects and over 10 years of experience specializing in developing digital banking products (product management, business analysis, and QA). As a QA engineer, I have experience testing web and mobile applications, including UI and back-end testing. I am proficient in API testing  (REST API via Postman). My background encompasses digital products such as online banking, core banking systems, eCommerce, payment services (Visa, Mastercard, UPC, Portmone), CRM, CMS, and MLM projects with intricate financial and bonus-rate business logic. 
I'm eager to develop my skills both as manual and automation QA. 
I've already developed knowledge and skills in the automation of API testing and these days I'm studying Cypress and Playwright.
I want to optimize and automate routine processes to gain time for more interesting tasks.

So here, on my GitHub repository, you can find some of my solutions for creating big data files for tests, using JSON files, and test-cases for running in Postman or via CLI.

- 👀 I’m interested in QA, automation, UI/UX, interior design
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Postman automation
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything about QA
